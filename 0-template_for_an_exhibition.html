	Here is an exhibition text, it revolves around bunnies for that was the photos i had on my hand <i> or computer for that sake </i>, while i was working on this template for the upcoming exhibition pages. Never the less, they have all been croped, but for my own sake i like having them around while working on the forthcoming exhibitions.
	Open image in new tab. Save for later. for now i am going to let the rest of the text be from the exhibition <i> AN EXHIBITON </i> you are doing it wrong. Your pocket is itching. A rash on you thigh. <i> I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes. </i> The drawbacks of haptic interfaces. Data sufferers sleep in the soft silk blankets of LCD screens. <i> It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go. </i> Save link for later. Like 50 tabs later. The panic/relief of a browser crash. A geomagnetic storm, a sudden data wipeout. <i> I see you face before me, as I lay on my bed. </i> The song on the radio is jammed by a cell phone signal. All thoughts stop as you listen to the pulsating buzz. What is a signal anyway. A vibration, heavy data transportation - <i> (bit by bit, bit by bitâ€¦). </i>
